# Intro: HTML
So you want to learn HTML, you want to make your own website you have seen the biggest websites and want your own virtual home on the internet.
# Creating The File
First create a folder anywhere on your hard drive, I would recommend in your documents folder then right click it should look like this
<br>
![New Folder](https://github.com/Vexify4/Docs/raw/main/images/image.png)
<br>
Click the new drop down should look like this 
<br>
![New Folder](https://github.com/Vexify4/Docs/raw/main/images/Screenshot%202021-10-26%20200944.png)
<br>
Finally click the folder button and click it
![New Folder](https://github.com/Vexify4/Docs/raw/main/images/Screenshot%202021-10-26%20201216.png)
Yay, you have now made your folder this will store all of your files for your website.
Now do the same thing but click create new text document make sure you have file name extentions click like this
<br>
![New File](https://github.com/Vexify4/Docs/raw/main/images/Screenshot%202021-10-26%20201954.png)
<br>
Once you make the file make sure it has .html get rid of the .txt. Congrats you have now made a HTML file get use to this name because I am going to use it a lot
# Editing The File
First you need a HTML editor I recommend Visual Studio Code but you can choose now that you have found your text editor you need to open the file. Once you have done that the first thing you are going to type is
<br>
`<!DOCTYPE html>`
<br>
This is telling the web browser what type of file it is. We now need to start our file with the opening being
<br>
`<html>`
<br>
Then add
<br>
`<head>`
<br>
and finally add
<br>
`<body>`
<br>
together it should look like
<br>
`<html>
 <head>
 <body>
 `
